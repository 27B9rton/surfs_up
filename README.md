# Surfs_up Analysis
This analysis was done for W. Avy to allow the data to convince him to invest in a Hawaiian surf and icecream shop. W. Avy was specifically interested in the weather's potential impact on sales.

## Results
Analysis was done on the island weather for June and December to see the two ends of the weather spectrum.

### December Results
- December had an average temperature of 71*
- December minimum temperature was 56.
- December Maximum temperature was 83.

## Summary and Next Steps
 The temperature data shows that the island is warm enough to generate ice cream sales year round, although some natural drop in sales during the slightly cooler months should be expected.
The next important analysis is to plot the monthly rain fall and monthly temperatures to see which months are the wettest. The precipitation level and temperature could be measured for all of the different Hawaiian islands to see which island has the warmest weather and least precipitation year round. For wetter months, less customers should be expected and inventory should probably be reduced.
